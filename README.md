GETTING STARTED
---------------

Once you installed SSO through Wabbajack the modlist should be ready to play...just launch the skse through MO2.

If you find performance is choppy then please refer to the BETHINI executable in MO2...you will be able to choose between presets or tweak the settings
to your liking to see if it improves performance.

If you find no animations are being used and Player or NPCs are T Posing then use the NEMESIS executable in MO2....just click update engine and Launch.
Nemesis Output should automatically go into the Nemesis Folder..if not then just move the overwrite data to Nemesis. The mod is located in the Output Separator.

IN GAME

Wait for all MCM Settings to load and then proceed to open the MCM to configure the game to the way you want to play.

Don't forget to open your inventory and read the Classes Book to choose your CLASS and BIRTH-SIGN.
 
Pickup whatever items you want...then talk to the Dragon to pick your start.

Next thing is.............DO WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT!!! ITS YOUR PLAYTHROUGH FROM HERE ON OUT!!!!!!! HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!
