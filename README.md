Welcome to Stunning Skyrim Overhaul

This is the first release of SSO so all feedback/criticism is appreciated.

Any problems you run into I will try and fix when possible...just post them in the BUGS channel in discord if you feel like joinning.

---------------
GETTING STARTED
---------------

Once you installed SSO through Wabbajack the modlist should be ready to play...just launch the skse through MO2.

If you find performance is choppy then please refer to the BETHINI executable in MO2...you will be able to choose between presets or tweak the settings
to your liking to see if it improves performance.

If you find no animations are being used and Player or NPCs are T Posing then use the NEMESIS executable in MO2....just click update engine and Launch.
Nemesis Output should automatically go into the Nemesis Folder..if not then just move the overwrite data to Nemesis. The mod is located in the Output Separator.

If you want to install/replace any mod that alters the exterior then you will need to rerun DYNDOLOD.
Just delete the SSELODGen_Output - TEXGEN_Output - Dyndolod_Output..located in the Dyndolod Separator.
Then run SSELODGen - TEXGEN - DYNDOLOD in that order.Just leave the settings as is and I ran Dyndolod in Medium Preset fyi....if you need more frames then run in a lower preset.
Just go into the folders of the applications listed above , make sure there is a zipped Output folder ( if not just zip the meshes/textures folder into a folder called modname_Output)
Then just install into MO2 and put back into the Dyndolod Separator. ( INSTALL EACH FOLDER AFTER YOU RUN EACH ONE.. DO NOT INSTALL AlL OF THEM AT THE END)

IN GAME
-------

Once you get ingame and create your character all I want you to do is open your inventory and read the Classes Book to choose your CLASS and BIRTH-SIGN.
 
Pickup whatever items you want...then talk to the Dragon to pick your start.

Next thing is.............DO WHATEVER THE FUCK YOU WANT!!! ITS YOUR PLAYTHROUGH FROM HERE ON OUT!!!!!!! HAVE FUN!!!!!!!!
